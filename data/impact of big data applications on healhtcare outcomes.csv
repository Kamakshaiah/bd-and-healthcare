The chronic disease like cerebral stroke results in demises of large number of human lives in an unpredicted way. Hence it is very important to have a prediction model to reduce the impact of such issues. The accuracy of the prediction model is purely based on the potential to extract the unique valid features from the dataset used in prediction. In this analytical study, we collected both structured and unstructured data from National Stroke Mortality dataset. Ten-fold cross validation was performed to both training and test sets. We proposed three classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision tree to predict the risk of stroke. As it is a life saving problem, the outcome of the model was evaluated on the basis of various performance and performance error measures. In order to prove the accuracy of the models, we made comparison with existing works and reached to a result that the decision tree shows a better performance than other models. With the selection of real life dataset, we could achieve an accuracy of 99% and it is experimentally proved that decision tree is best for the prediction of risk in cerebral stroke. © 2019 IEEE.","accuracy; big data; classifier; risk prediction; stroke","Artificial life; Big data; Classifiers; Computational methods; Data Analytics; Decision trees; Diseases; Nearest neighbor search; accuracy; Analytical studies; Computational model; K-nearest neighbors; Performance error; Risk predictions; stroke; Unstructured data; Forecasting"

Much information remains in paper form, lack common standards, sharing is uncommon and frequently hampered by the lack of foolproof de-identification for patient privacy. All of these issues impede opportunities for data mining and analysis that would enable better predictive and preventive medicine. These issues are compounded in emerging economies due to geopolitical constraints, transportation and geographic barriers, a much more limited clinical workforce, and infrastructural challenges to delivery. Thus, simple, high-impact deliverable interventions such as universal childhood immunization and maternal childcare are hampered by poor monitoring and reporting systems. This workshop is focused on identifying challenges to be overcome for effectively delivering efficient healthcare and to the masses. Specifically, we will provide a forum to discuss research directions, share experience and insights from both academia and industry.

Despite the fact that many methods have been developed in the past to analyze unstructured collections of multidimensional objects, graph analytic technologies are a recent trend that poses several challenges, not only in terms of the output of algorithms that are related to data mining that facilitate algorithmic computational data discovery [3]. Graph analytics primarily aimed to evaluate graph oriented structured data in order to uncover answers to queries (e.g. Identify the person who is the most prominent person in a community? What are the main technology nodes for better practice and decision-making on the internet and urban networks?) Analysis of graphs has always attracted and has always been an important topic for researchers in the history of computing; however, the rise of the uses of advanced analytics for large amounts of semi-structured or unstructured data and the revolution of big data has lately picked up the interest of the information systems community [1]. The qualitative effect of data, as well as the impact of graph analytics technology on organizations, has affected the requirements for business outcomes. Graph analytics for big data can not only recognize but also visualize crucial insights in big data. Furthermore, graph analytics may assist in identifying associations between different types of data and determining their existence and meaning within the context [2]. In this chapter, we will present the fundamentals of graph analytics and how graphs are related to big data. The chapter will also show some of the most common graph databases and discuss various big data graph analytics approaches which use the massive datasets, as well as different frameworks for each approach. In the latter part of the chapter, various issues and challenges related to big graph analytics will be addressed.

However, it is unknown whether these investments have achieved the desired goals. We performed a scoping review to determine the health and economic impact of big data analytics for clinical decision-making. Materials and Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the National Health Services Economic Evaluations Database for relevant articles. We included peer-reviewed papers that report the health economic impact of analytics that assist clinical decision-making. We extracted the economic methods and estimated impact and also assessed the quality of the methods used. In addition, we estimated how many studies assessed “big data analytics” based on a broad definition of this term. Results: The search yielded 12 133 papers but only 71 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Only a few papers were full economic evaluations; many were performed during development. Papers frequently reported savings for healthcare payers but only 20% also included costs of analytics. Twenty studies examined “big data analytics” and only 7 reported both cost-savings and better outcomes. Discussion: The promised potential of big data is not yet reflected in the literature, partly since only a few full and properly performed economic evaluations have been published.

Green Healthcare, Green Computing, and Green IT (Information Technology) are all excellent ways to reduce electricity use and save money doing it. Globally, the healthcare sector is growing in importance and plays a key role in world economics. The healthcare sector makes heavy use of technology including social media. Technological advances have revolutionized the healthcare industry worldwide - from modern testing techniques to improved surgical equipment, remote health monitoring technologies with the help of modern digital equipment, etc. There are many online healthcare portals. The complexity of the healthcare industry helps account for the large environmental footprint. A big challenge facing the healthcare sector is how best to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of this very complex system. Efforts over the past few years to analyze and create highly efficient data centers presents an excellent opportunity for cost effective Green IT at hospitals. Given the complexity of the healthcare industry, there is a need for extensive use of data science, Big Data, and analytics as an ideal way to determine how green healthcare outcomes can be improved.

Curation of large multi-institutional datasets of high-quality data has allowed for significant advances in the timeliness of quality improvement efforts. Improved access to large datasets and computational power have also paved the way for the development of high-performing, data-driven decision support tools and precision medicine approaches. However, implementation of these approaches and tools into pediatric practice has been hindered by challenges in our ability to adequately capture the heterogeneity of the pediatric population as well as the nuanced complexities of pediatric diseases such as sepsis. Moreover, there are large gaps in knowledge and definitive evidence demonstrating the utility, usability, and effectiveness of these types of tools in pediatric practice, which presents significant challenges to provider willingness to leverage these solutions.

It is also called IoT in healthcare, facilitating secure communication of remote healthcare devices over the Internet for quick and flexible analysis of healthcare data. In other words, IoMT is an amalgam of medical devices and applications, which improves overall healthcare outcomes. However, this system is prone to security- and privacy-related attacks on healthcare data. Therefore, providing a robust security mechanism to prevent the attacks and vulnerability of IoMT is essential. To mitigate this, we proposed a new Artificial-Intelligence envisioned secure communication scheme for IoMT. The discussed network and threat models provide details of the associated network arrangement of the IoMT devices and attacks relevant to IoMT. Furthermore, we provide the security analysis of the proposed scheme to show its security against different possible attacks.

Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models-one for each event-and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research.","Bayesian data analysis; Design science; Electronic health records; Health IT; Healthcare predictive analytics; Multitask learning","Big data; Decision making; Design; Health; Health care; Health risks; Learning systems; Records management; Risk assessment; Bayesian data analysis; Design science; Electronic health record; Health it; Multitask learning; Predictive analytics"

The use of big data is key to understanding factors that affect the patient's health status and enhancing clinicians' ability to anticipate how the patient will respond to various therapies. Big data is essential to delivering sustainable, highquality, value-based healthcare, as well as to the success of new models of care such as clinically integrated networks (CINs) and accountable care organizations.Sentara Healthcare, based in Norfolk, Virginia, has been an early adopter of the technologies that have readied us for our big data journey: EHRs, telehealth-supported electronic intensive care units, and telehealth primary care support through MDLIVE. Although we would not say Sentara is at the cutting edge of the big data trend, it certainly is among the fast followers. Use of big data in healthcare is still at an early stage compared with other industries. Tools for data analytics are maturing, but traditional challenges such as heightened data security and limited human resources remain the primary focus for regional health systems to improve care and reduce costs. Sentara primarily makes actionable use of big data in our CIN, Sentara Quality Care Network, and at our health plan, Optima Health. Big data projects can be expensive, and justifying the expense organizationally has often been easier in times of crisis. We have developed an analytics strategic plan separate from but aligned with corporate system goals to ensure optimal investment and management of this essential asset.","","Accountable Care Organizations; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Informatics; Quality of Health Care; Telemedicine; Virginia; accountable care organization; electronic health record; health care quality; human; integrated health care system; medical informatics; telemedicine; Virginia"

When compared to classical techniques, DL does not need data which is specific to a domain. DL is likely to transform the lives of humans. Regardless of these benefits, DL faces certain drawbacks related to data (higher number of features, dissimilar data, reliance on time, unsupervised data, etc.) & model (dependability, understandable, likelihood, scalable, safety) for real world applications. This chapter emphasizes on DL techniques applied in MI & PH, recent case studies related to the application of DL in MI & PH, and certain critical research questions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; Analysis; Big-data analytics; Prediction","Big data; Clinical research; Data Analytics; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Medical computing; Medical informatics; Analyse; Clinical settings; Community health; Community OR; General publics; Global regions; Local community; Medical computer science; Medical informatics; Patient care; Public health"

An optimal interaction between a patient and a ventilator is therefore paramount. Suboptimal interaction is present when patients repeatedly demand, but do not receive, breathing support from a mechanical ventilator (> 30 times in 3 min), also known as an ineffective effort event (IEEV). IEEVs are associated with increased hospital mortality prolonged intensive care stay, and prolonged time on ventilation and thus development of real-time analytics that identify IEEVs is essential. To assist decision-making about further development we estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of real-time analytics that identify ineffective effort events. Methods: We developed a cost-effectiveness model combining a decision tree and Markov model for long-term outcomes with data on current care from a Greek hospital and literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare payer perspective were used. Uncertainty about the results was assessed using sensitivity and scenario analyses to examine the impact of varying parameters like the intensive care costs per day and the effectiveness of treatment of IEEVs. Results: Use of the analytics could lead to reduced mortality (3% absolute reduction), increased quality adjusted life years (0.21 per patient) and cost-savings (€264 per patient) compared to current care. Moreover, cost-savings for hospitals and health improvements can be incurred even if the treatment’s effectiveness is reduced from 30 to 10%. The estimated savings increase to €1,155 per patient in countries where costs of an intensive care day are high (e.g. the Netherlands). There is considerable headroom for development and the analytics generate savings when the price of the analytics per bed per year is below €7,307. Furthermore, even when the treatment’s effectiveness is 10%, the probability that the analytics are cost-effective exceeds 90%. Conclusions: Implementing real-time analytics to identify ineffective effort events can lead to health and financial benefits. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to continue assessment of the effectiveness of the analytics in clinical practice and validate our findings. Eventually, their adoption in settings where costs of an intensive care day are high and ineffective efforts are frequent could yield a high return on investment. © 2020, The Author(s).","Big data analytics; Cost- effectiveness analysis; Intensive care unit; Interactive ventilator support; Ventilation","adoption; adult; article; big data; clinical practice; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; decision tree; female; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; investment; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; Netherlands; probability; quality adjusted life year; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty; ventilated patient"

Given their potential impact on clinical processes and decision-making, AI-based health technologies (AIHT) are now seen to have a transformative effect on the nursing and medical professions, and on advanced nursing practice in particular. Aims: While nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly called upon to play a crucial role in improving the healthcare provided to the population, little is known about the nature, extent and outcomes of their involvement and experience with AIHT. This study's research objectives are twofold. First, it aims to characterize NPs' involvement and experience with AIHT in terms of the functional and clinical attributes of the AIHT-based systems and applications that have emerged in advanced nursing care settings, and of the clinical tasks of NPs targeted for support by these systems and applications. Second, it aims to characterize this involvement and experience with AIHT in terms of its expected impacts on the clinical activities and performance of NPs, and of its potential outcomes for NPs' patients and for the general population. Method: We thus contribute to advanced practice nursing research by carrying out an initial evaluation of the role played by NPs in the emergence of these technologies, by means of a systematic review of the literature. Findings: This review demonstrates that NPs, acting alone or in collaboration with physicians and other healthcare professionals, participate in the development and evaluation of various AI-based decision-making and predictive tools in primary, hospital and emergency care settings. This participation involves NPs as diagnostic and therapeutic experts whose clinical activities, decision-making and performance can be significantly impacted by their adoption and assimilation of AIHT. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Advances nursing practice; Artificial intelligence; Clinical decision support; Machine learning; Nurse practitioner; Outcome prediction; Systematic review","Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Nurse Practitioners; Nursing Care; adoption; adult; advanced practice nursing; article; artificial intelligence; decision making; decision support system; emergency care; female; human; machine learning; male; nurse practitioner; nursing care; outcome assessment; physician; prediction; systematic review; artificial intelligence; health care delivery; health care personnel; nursing care"

The conventional drug discovery process is complicated, time-consuming and costly, and some of the main factors that make it amenable to failure include lack of effectiveness, adverse reactions, poor pharmacokinetics and marketable reasons. Traditional medicine (TM), used conventionally, is subjected to rigorous research for its efficacy and safety, which increases both the time and cost of the process. With rapidly changing economic scenario, the need for utilizing novel approaches for evidence-based clinical drug development that overcomes these facets of TM has increased leading to the increased usage of predictive modelling. The whole process of predictive analytics finds its roots with drug design and development. Some latest approaches in predictive healthcare for predicting clinical outcomes are done by modelling to optimize the dosage of drugs and also to evaluate potential adverse mechanism. Big data analytics, data mining and text mining are the latest technologies being used in predictive analytics. These technologies have helped in the prediction, treatment and effective diagnosis of diseases which has brought a lot of significant changes such as in the service quality which is being provided and most importantly cost reduction. This chapter involves various steps being followed for the development of a drug in the USA. Development of drug from identifying the protein to its clinical testing and post-market trials has many phases and involves approval of certain applications. This chapter is an attempt to encompass Internet of Things (IoT) and in silico approaches to address various healthcare components including predictive analytics. In silico modelling tools can be used for prediction of dosage and pathway-related adverse effects in humans as well as machine learning can be used in the prediction of the chemical toxicity during drug design. In silico design methods can reduce the average cost to develop a drug considerably, and it can minimize therapeutic risks efficiently. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) along with clinical trial simulation concepts helps in facilitating key decisions in drug delivery management and regulatory approval. Use of IoT-enabled devices to remotely monitor patient’s health helps in reducing the length of hospital stay and prevents readmissions. This analysis is achieved by the use of cloud-centric architecture, wherein the physical activities of users are monitored in primary health centres. If these results obtained exceed the overall threshold value, then an alert is sent to the healthcare personnel thereby preventing any severe complications that might occur. Thus it has a major impact on reducing healthcare costs significantly and improving treatment outcomes. Some IoT applications are in devices for the remote patient monitoring (RPM) like the glucose metres for the patients having diabetes. Blood pressure can be monitored by automated blood pressure cuffs. However, IoT comes with certain limitations like it demands faster processing of the generated data, large data volume, variation and velocity and the requirement for accuracy, quality of service (QoS), security and user expectations, and operational costs arise as a result of large utilization of sensors, mobility and geographic distribution. Cloud computing services are widely in use to mitigate these negatives, using IoT-enabled healthcare solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Clinical trials; Cloud computing; Drug development; In silico drug design; In silico drug design; Internet of Things (IoT); Predictive analytics; Predictive healthcare; Traditional medicine","Blood; Blood pressure; Commerce; Cost reduction; Data Analytics; Design; Diagnosis; Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Drug products; Forecasting; Geographical distribution; Medical applications; Predictive analytics; Quality of service; Remote patient monitoring; Text mining; Cloud computing services; Delivery management; In-silico drug design; Internet of Things (IOT); Length of hospital stays; Next-generation sequencing; Predictive modelling; Regulatory approvals; Internet of things"

The energy use of the healthcare sector (whose largest sub-segment is 'hospitals') has been growing due to many factors. These factors include the rapid growth and adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in healthcare. The new IT technologies and applications used in healthcare include 'cloud computing', 'mMedicine', i.e. 'mobility in Health', eHealth, and tele(health) care for 'remote delivery of healthcare services'. The healthcare industry needs to reap the benefits of emerging technologies such as Data Science, Big Data, Analytics, Mobile computing and Cloud computing, along with the use of Health Information Technology (HIT) to help solve the ever growing operating cost problems. A big challenge facing the healthcare sector is how best to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of this very complex sector. The work done over the past few years to analyze and create very energy efficient data centers presents an excellent opportunity for cost effective green IT at hospitals. Because of the complexity of the healthcare industry, there is a need for an extensive use of data science and Big Data analytics as an ideal way to help determine how the green healthcare outcomes can be improved. Hospitals and healthcare can make significant steps in the green direction by combining big data analytics with cloud computing. Information Technology (IT) is continually being refreshed at hospitals and most organizations as part of the need for the hospitals to keep vital technology up to date. Any electronic waste (eWaste) from this refresh cycle must be recycled as part of a sustainability program. Replacing the IT equipment and upgrading the application architecture with energy efficient systems such as virtual servers, virtual data storage, and efficient application and database structures, can easily reduce IT power consumption for the replaced equipment by 50 percent. A second compelling reason to move to green IT is that virtual server and virtual data storage technology are methods that allow hospitals to reduce equipment and system management costs. Include private cloud computing for both your production and test / development systems, and the savings are even greater. So the latest green technology is based around a very solid business case without even considering the savings due to reduction in energy costs. This paper gives examples of how Data Science, Big Data, and Analytics can be used in healthcare to significantly improve a hospital's IT Energy Efficiency along with information on the best ways to improve energy efficiency for healthcare in a cost effective manner. This paper builds on the work done in other sectors (mainly data centers) in effectively measuring and improving IT energy efficiency. © 2015 IEEE.","analytics; Big Data; carbon footprint; cloud computing; data science; Green IT; healthcare; HIT; mobile computing; protected health information","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Equipment; Health; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Medical computing; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile computing; Sustainable development; analytics; Application architecture; data science; Electronic waste (e waste); Green IT; Health information technologies (HIT); Information and Communication Technologies; Protected health informations; Big data"

Background: Depression is a common and often undiagnosed condition for patients with diabetes. It is also a condition that significantly impacts healthcare outcomes, use, and cost as well as elevating suicide risk. Therefore, a model to predict depression among diabetes patients is a promising and valuable tool for providers to proactively assess depressive symptoms and identify those with depression. Objectives: This study seeks to develop a generalized multilevel regression model, using a longitudinal data set from a recent large-scale clinical trial, to predict depression severity and presence of major depression among patients with diabetes. Methods: Severity of depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 score. Predictors were selected from 29 candidate factors to develop a 2-level Poisson regression model that can make population-average predictions for all patients and subject- specific predictions for individual patients with historical records. Newly obtained patient records can be incorporated with historical records to update the prediction model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were used to evaluate predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores. The study also evaluated the classification ability of using the predicted PHQ-9 scores to classify patients as having major depression. Results: Two time-invariant and 10 timevarying predictors were selected for the model. Incorporating historical records and using them to update the model may improve both predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores and classification ability of the predicted scores. Subject-specific predictions (for individual patients with historical records) achieved RMSE about 4 and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve about 0.9 and are better than populationaverage predictions. Conclusions: The study developed a generalized multilevel regression model to predict depression and demonstrated that using generalized multilevel regression based on longitudinal patient records can achieve high predictive ability. © Schattauer 2015.","Comorbidity; Depression; Diabetes mellitus; Machine learning; Multilevel regression","California; Causality; Computer Simulation; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Depression; Diabetes Complications; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Prevalence; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; California; causality; classification; clinical decision support system; computer simulation; depression; Diabetes Complications; electronic health record; human; longitudinal study; machine learning; natural language processing; organization and management; prevalence; prognosis; proportional hazards model; regression analysis; reproducibility; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; statistics and numerical data"

Along these same lines, advances in the field of genomics are revolutionizing biomedical research, both in terms of data volume and prospects, as well as in terms of the social impact it entails.The potential of Big Data applications that consider all of the above levels of health information lies in the possibility of combining and integrating de-identified health information to allow secondary uses of data. This is the use and re-use of various sources of health information for purposes in addition to the direct clinical care of specific patients or the direct investigation of specific biomedical research hypotheses. Current applications include: epidemiological and pharmacovigilance studies, facilitating recruitment to randomized controlled trials, carrying out audits and benchmarking studies, financial and service planning, and ultimately supporting the generation of novel biomedical research outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital health; Health analytics; Health forecasting; Predictive modeling; Secondary use of data","adult; benchmarking; controlled study; drug surveillance program; electronic health record; electronic patient record; electronic prescribing; expectation; forecasting; genomics; health care delivery; human; lifestyle; medical information; medical research; personal monitoring; prospective study; radiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; social network"

Along with other potential challenges across different domains, it has brought numerous cybersecurity challenges that must be tackled timely to protect victims and critical infrastructure. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target. The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria. As an outcome of this research study; we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks. Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are; ransomware, trojans, and bots. We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we identified the open challenges, general recommendations, and prospective solutions for future work from the researcher and practitioner communities by using the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; cyber-attacks and threats; Multivocal literature review; prospective solutions; security and privacy; social engineering","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Critical infrastructures; Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Health care; Hospitals; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Network security; Public works; Different domains; Healthcare services; Latest technology; Literature reviews; Quality assessment; Social and economic impacts; Social engineering; State of the practice; Malware"

In this context, we study big data from social media over a 7-year time span to gauge evolving perceptions of mental health, and discuss our research findings, potentially useful for decision support in healthcare. We deploy topic modeling and sentiment analysis to estimate public perceptions of mental health issues, focusing on Twitter as the social media site. We claim that it is important to consider polarity as well as subjectivity in sentiment analysis to comprehend two different aspects of sentiment, i.e. orientation in the emotion, and extent of fact vs. opinion. We assert that ranking via topic modeling is beneficial to fathom the relative importance of issues over the years. We harness tools/techniques from natural language processing and data mining to discover knowledge from big data on social media, related to mental health. Some of our findings reveal that the sentiment around mental health has remained positive overall, but has decreased since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Major events, such as elections and the pandemic, greatly impact the conversation surrounding mental health. Some topics have remained consistent throughout the years. In other topics, the tone of the public discussions has shifted. The outcomes of our study would be useful to a variety of professionals, ranging from data scientists to epidemiologists and psychologists.

Although prior research has explored the impact that BDA has on business growth, there is a lack of research that explains the full complexity of BDA implementations. Examination of how and under what conditions BDA achieves organizational performance from a holistic perspective is absent from the existing literature. Extending the theoretical perspective from the traditional views (e.g. resource-based theory) to configuration theory, the authors have developed a conceptual model of BDA success that aims to investigate how BDA capabilities interact with complementary organizational resources and organizational capabilities in multiple configuration solutions leading to higher quality of care in healthcare organizations. To test this model, the authors use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyse multi-source data acquired from a survey and databases maintained by the Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The findings suggest that BDA, when given alone, is not sufficient in achieving the outcome, but is a synergy effect in which BDA capabilities and analytical personnel's skills together with organizational resources and capabilities as supportive role can improve average excess readmission rates and patient satisfaction in healthcare organizations. © 2019 British Academy of Management","",""

When it comes to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol test results, lower values are preferable. This paper details a factor analytical method whose main objective is to create a very effective risk prediction model for cardiovascular incidence. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to generate and test the hypothesis. To investigate the attributes' associations with and relevance to cardiovascular, a data understanding analysis is specifically carried out. This paper aims to evaluate the variables affecting LDL-C by using data analytics. Consistency, convergent, and discriminant have all been considered when evaluating the prediction model. The results showed that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) significantly reduces LDL with (P 0.001, = 0.04), whereas, total cholesterol (TC) has a considerable impact on LDL with (P 0.001, r = 0.92), whereas, Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) significantly affects LDL with (P 0.001, = −0.16) and, triglycerides (TG) significantly affects LDL with (P 0.001, = −0.20). The outcome will be a prediction model based on a neural network and data analysis. © 2023 The Authors","Big data; Data analysis; Factors; LDL-C; Sensors","Cholesterol; Data Analytics; Data handling; Forecasting; Information analysis; Lipoproteins; Analytical method; Cardiovascular disease; Data analysis-methods; Factor; Healthcare sectors; Lipoprotein cholesterol; Low density lipoproteins; Low-density lipoprotein-C; Risk prediction models; Big data"
